and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

  - macOS: Notifications appear in Notification Center with "default" system sound
  - Windows: Notifications appear in Windows notification system with sound
  - Linux: Notifications appear via system notification daemon with sound
- Notification includes task name and encouraging message
